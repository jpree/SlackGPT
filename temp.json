For example, if you need help with a task, you can say something like "Hey <@U0561DSLA3U>, can you help me with this task?"\n\n2. I can also provide helpful information on various topics. For example, if you want to know the weather in a particular location, you can say something like "What\"s the weather like in San Francisco today?" and I\"ll provide you with the current weather conditions.\n\n3. I can also help you schedule meetings with your colleagues. For example, you can say something like "Can you schedule a meeting with <@U12345678> next Monday at 2pm?" and I\"ll create a calendar invite for you.\n\n4. If you want to share a link with your colleagues, you can simply paste the link and I\"ll automatically create a clickable preview. For example, if you paste a link to an article, I\"ll display a preview of the article with a thumbnail image, title, and description.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there\"s anything else I can assist you with!",
